picoCTF-web
===========

The picoCTF-web project consists of the competitor facing web site, the api for running a CTF, as well as management functionality for CTF organizers.

Quick Start
------------
Though it is possible to use picoCTF-web as a stand alone component, it is best integrated with the rest of the [picoCTF-platform](https://github.com/picoCTF/picoCTF-platform). Please consult the Quick Start section of that repository for the simplest way to begin using this component.

Features
------------

The picoCTF-web platform provides a number of core features that are common across jeopardy style CTFs such as:

- Problem List - where challenges are presented to competitors and they can submit flags with optional hints, and categories.  Also the ability for challenges to be "locked" and hidden until a competitor hits a certain score threshold.
- Scoreboard - for both individual progress within a category as well as across a competition.

Also the picoCTF-web platform provides a number of features that are useful for running CTFs in an educational setting:

- Classrooms - to manage multiple distinct groups of competitors as in a school setting. 
- Shell accounts - through integration with the [picoCTF-shell-manager](https://github.com/picoCTF/picoCTF-shell-manager) to allow competitors full access to necessary challenges and tools with only a web browser.
